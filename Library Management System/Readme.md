# Library Management System

 * create an ER diagram for a Library Management System in MySQL, we need to identify the main entities and their attributes, as well as define the relationships between these entities. Here's a step-by-step outline of how to approach this task:

# Entities and Attributes

1. Students
   
• StudentID (Primary Key)
• FirstName
• LastName
• EnrollmentNumber
• Email
• PhoneNumber

2. Teachers

• TeacherID (Primary Key)
• FirstName
• LastName
• Department
• Email
• PhoneNumber

3. Books
   
• BookID (Primary Key)
• Title
• Author
• Publisher
• ISBN
• Category
• NumberOfCopies

4. IssuedBooks

• IssueID (Primary Key)
• BookID (Foreign Key)
• IssuerID (Foreign Key - can be either StudentID or TeacherID)
• IssuerType (enum: 'Student', 'Teacher')
• IssueDate
• ReturnDate
• FineAmount

# Relationships

Students and Teachers have a many-to-many relationship with Books through the IssuedBooks table.
Each Book can be issued by multiple Students and Teachers.
Each issue record in IssuedBooks will have one book and one issuer (either a student or a teacher).

# ER Diagram

Let's describe the relationships:

• A Student can issue multiple Books.
• A Teacher can issue multiple Books.
• A Book can be issued to multiple Students and Teachers.

The IssuedBooks table serves as an associative entity that establishes these many-to-many relationships.

# ER Diagram Creation Steps

1. Identify the entities and list their attributes.
2. Define primary keys for each entity.
3. Identify foreign keys to establish relationships.
4. Draw the entities as rectangles.
5. Connect entities with lines to show relationships.
6. Label the relationships and add cardinality.
